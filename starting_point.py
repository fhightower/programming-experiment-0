# The goal is to create a mine-sweeper board with the given number of cols, rows, and mines
# The board should use "x" for mines and each square should contain the number of adjacent mines
# (consider squares in both cardinal and ordinal directions)

# For example, a 3x3 board with 3 mines should look something like:
# 1 2 2
# 1 x x
# 1 3 x

create_board(3, 3, 3)

create_board(11, 2, 1)
